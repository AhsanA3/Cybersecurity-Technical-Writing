# Proof of Concept (PoC) Directory

This repository documents various Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrations for known vulnerabilities as part of my ongoing journey in the field of cybersecurity. The purpose of this repository is to showcase how specific vulnerabilities can be exploited in controlled environments for educational and research purposes. These PoC write-ups reflect my hands-on experience and exploration of penetration testing and vulnerability research.

## Overview

Each PoC write-up in this directory includes detailed technical documentation of vulnerabilities and exploits, focusing on how they can be identified, reproduced, and mitigated. These demonstrations aim to:

- **Explain the Vulnerability**: Provide an overview of the vulnerability, its CVE ID (if applicable), affected systems, and potential impact.
- **Step-by-Step Exploitation Process**: Detailed instructions on how to exploit the vulnerability, along with any payloads or code used in the process.
- **Proof of Concept Results**: Evidence of successful exploitation, often with screenshots or logs to validate the PoC.
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Practical advice or fixes to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a reflection of my learning path in the cybersecurity space. It serves as a technical record of the practical skills Iâ€™m developing in penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and ethical hacking.

If you're interested in detailed **installation guides, tutorials, or how-to documentation** on setting up security tools, check out my other repository: **[Technical Documentation](https://github.com/AhsanA3/Cybersecurity-Technical-Writing/tree/main/Technical%20Documentation)**, where I focus on explaining how to install, run, and use various cybersecurity tools and utilities.

## Disclaimer

The Proof of Concept demonstrations included in this repository are for **educational and research purposes only**.

## Usage

Navigate through the `PoCs/` directory to explore individual vulnerability write-ups. Each PoC focuses on a specific vulnerability, including technical details, commands, scripts, and results from successful exploitation. Contributions, improvements, or suggestions are always welcome via pull requests.
